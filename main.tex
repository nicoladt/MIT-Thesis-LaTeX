Systems to annotate online content are becoming increasingly common on the World Wide Web. While much research and development has been done for interfaces that allow users to make and view annotations, few annotation systems provide functionality that extends beyond this and allows users to also manage and process collections of existing annotations.\\
\\
Siyavula Education is a social enterprise that publishes high school Maths and Science textbooks online. The company uses annotations to collate collaborator and volunteer feedback (corrections, opinions, suggestions) about its books at various phases in the book-writing life cycle.  \\
\\
Currently the company captures annotations on PDF versions of their books. The web-based software they use allows for some filtering and sorting of existing annotations, but the system is limited and not ideal for their rather specialised requirements. \\
\\
In an attempt to move away from a proprietary, PDF-based system Siyavula implemented Annotator (\href{http://okfnlabs.org/annotator/}{http://okfnlabs.org/annotator/}), software which allowed for the annotation of HTML pages. However, this software was not coupled with a back-end interface that would allow users to interact with a database of saved annotations. \\
\\
To enable this kind of interaction, a prototype interface was designed and is presented here. The purpose of the interface was to give users new and improved functionality for querying and manipulating a collection of web-based annotations about Siyavulaâ€™s online content.\\
\\
Usability tests demonstrated that the interface was successful at giving users this new and necessary functionality (including filtering, sorting and searching) to process annotations. \\ 
\\
Once integrated with front-end software (such as Annotator) and issue tracking software (such as GitHub) the interface could form part of a powerful new tool for the making and management of annotations on the Web.

The completion of this dissertation (and the rest of my degree) would not have been possible without the endless love, support and encouragement of my partner Ewald, my parents Jill and Pierre and my extended family and friends who are too numerous to name individually. To Ewald particularly, multiverses of gratitude and love are due not only for help with the back-end development involved in this research, but also for putting up with much grumpiness, impatience and exhaustion. I could not have completed this thesis without his support and sanity-restoring advice. \\
\\
Thanks are also due to my employers, colleagues and friends at Siyavula for giving me the time and space to do this research and being extremely willing and enthusiastic users.\\
\\
My extraordinary supervisor, Gary Marsden, passed away suddenly just weeks before I was due to submit this dissertation. The loss of Gary is a profound tragedy for his family, his students, his colleagues and the HCI community at large. While I grieve for him still and there will forever be a Gary-shaped hole in the universe (to paraphrase Arundhati Roy) I am honoured to have been one of his "minions" and will always be grateful for the time I had with him. I only wish he could see this work in its completed form. 

I am indebted to Associate Professor Sonia Berman (UCT) and Professor Yvonne Rogers (University College London), who helped me through the last few weeks of this process and gave me invaluable advice and encouragement. 

On a lighter note, acknowledgement for completion of this dissertation must also be given to Daft Punk and Swedish House Mafia: because sometimes one just needs a heavy beat to get things done.
